Gold price Prediction model

This project focuses on predicting gold prices using machine learning techniques based on historical data and economic indicators. Gold, being a highly traded and volatile commodity, is influenced by multiple financial factors. The goal of this project was to understand these patterns and use data-driven models to forecast future trends.

📌 Use Case
The model can be used by analysts, traders, or finance students as a basic tool for understanding gold price movements. It can also serve as a starting point for more complex financial forecasting systems.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Models Used: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Evaluation Metrics: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)

🔍 Workflow
Data Collection: Used a dataset with historical gold prices and related economic indicators (e.g., oil prices, interest rates, stock indexes).

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and scaling features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends, correlations, and seasonal patterns in gold prices.

Model Building: Trained multiple regression models to predict the gold price.

Model Evaluation: Compared model performances using regression metrics.

Prediction: Made final predictions and analyzed their accuracy on test data.

🎯 Outcome
The model was able to capture general price trends and gave reasonably accurate predictions. While real-world forecasting involves more complexity, this project served as a practical introduction to time series modeling and financial data analysis.
